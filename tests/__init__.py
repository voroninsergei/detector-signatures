"""
Package for unit tests of the signature detector system (stageÂ 8).

These tests are designed to verify the basic functionality of the preprocessing,
feature extraction, comparative analysis and report generation modules.
The tests rely on simple synthetic images created with NumPy and OpenCV.

Use ``pytest`` to run the tests:

```
pytest -q signature_detector/tests
```
